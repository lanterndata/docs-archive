## Sign Up

Sign up for Lantern Cloud [here](https://lantern.dev). We're currently running a closed beta program. Reach out at [support@lantern.dev](mailto:support@lantern.dev) for access. We'd love to hear more about your use case and we're happy to help.

## Run your database

Once you have a database URL, you can access your database using `psql` and run vector queries. See our [Develop Guide](/develop/overview) for more details.

```sql
CREATE TABLE lantern_demo (id SERIAL, v REAL[3]);
INSERT INTO lantern_demo (v) VALUES ('{0, 0, 0}'), ('{0, 1, 0}'), ('{1, 0, 0}');
CREATE INDEX ON lantern_demo USING hnsw(v) WITH (m=4, ef_construction=8);
SELECT * FROM lantern_demo ORDER BY v <-> ARRAY[1,1,1];
```
