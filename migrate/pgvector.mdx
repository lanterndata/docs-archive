title: "Migrate from pgvector"
---

Lantern works seamlessly alongside pgvector and is compatible with the `vector` type. If you already have a Postgres database running with pgvector, you can easily install and use Lantern without encountering any issues.

Upon installing Lantern using one of the methods mentioned in the sections above, it will automatically detect the presence of the existing `hnsw` access method in your database and create `lantern_hnsw` instead.

## Migrating from pgvector

Suppose you already have a Postgres table with a vector index created using pgvector, like this:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
CREATE TABLE lantern_pgvector (id SERIAL, v vector(3)); -- 'vector' is the type provided by pgvector
INSERT INTO lantern_pgvector (v) VALUES ('[0,0,0]'), ('[0,1,0]'), ('[1,0,0]');
CREATE INDEX vector_idx ON lantern_pgvector USING hnsw(v vector_l2_ops) WITH (m=4, ef_construction=8); -- This 'hnsw' access method is provided by pgvector
```

You can install Lantern over it without any issues

```sql
SET enable_seqscan=off; -- Always use the index on scans for demonstration purposes

-- Lantern will detect the presence of another 'hnsw' access method in your database and will add 'lantern_hnsw' instead. (A warning will be displayed in your psql console)
CREATE EXTENSION lantern;
CREATE INDEX lantern_idx ON lantern_pgvector USING lantern_hnsw(v) WITH (m=4, ef_construction=8);
DROP INDEX vector_idx;
SELECT * FROM lantern_pgvector ORDER BY v <-> '[1,1,1]'; -- 'lantern_idx' will be used for this scan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM lantern_pgvector ORDER BY v <-> '[1,1,1]'; -- You can verify that 'lantern_idx' is used here
```

<Note>
  To completily remove pgvector from your database you will need to migrate your
  data type from `vector` to `REAL[]` and then drop the extension.
