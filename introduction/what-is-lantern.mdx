title: "What is Lantern"
---

Lantern is open-source Postgres extension for vector data and vector search operations.

## Fully Managed

In Lantern Cloud we provide fully managed Postgres database powered with Lantern Tools to give the best developer experience while building AI applications and working with vector data.

## No Need to Learn New Technologies

You can focus on writing your application logic instead of learning new technologies. Lantern is built on top of Postgres and is 100% compatible with your existing Postgres data. We've further simplified things: there's no need to remember which operator corresponds to which distance function. We export a single `<->` operator that will infer the correct distance function based on your index parameters.

## Next Level Developer Productivity

Within Lantern Cloud, we offer tools to generate vector embeddings from your existing Postgres data using various available sentence transformer models and add an HNSW index on top of it. With Lantern Cloud, you can iterate more swiftly, identifying the optimal matching embedding model and index parameters for your data within minutes instead of waiting hours to index your data or creating embeddings with third-party tools and then importing them into your database.

## Open Source

Our entire codebase is 100% open source, including the [Core database extension](https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern.git) and [Lantern Tools](https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras.git).

## Compatibility

Lantern is fully compatible with applications utilizing the official release of Postgres. We offer support for Postgres versions 11 through 16.
